# Transparent Public Utility Subsidy Management

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based system for transparent management of public utility subsidies. By leveraging smart contracts, the platform ensures fair distribution of assistance while maintaining accountability, reducing administrative overhead, and preventing fraud.

## Key Components

1. **Recipient Verification Contract**: Validates eligibility for utility assistance through secure identity verification and criteria assessment
2. **Benefit Calculation Contract**: Determines appropriate subsidy amounts based on predefined formulas and recipient circumstances
3. **Distribution Contract**: Manages application of subsidies directly to utility bills, ensuring funds are properly allocated
4. **Usage Monitoring Contract**: Tracks consumption patterns of subsidy recipients to prevent abuse and optimize program effectiveness

## How It Works

1. Potential recipients apply for utility assistance through a secure portal
2. Verification contract validates eligibility using predefined criteria
3. Calculation contract determines appropriate subsidy amount
4. Distribution contract applies subsidies directly to utility bills
5. Monitoring contract tracks usage patterns to prevent abuse and gather data for program optimization

## Benefits

- Complete transparency in subsidy allocation and distribution
- Reduced administrative costs through automation
- Prevention of fraud and misuse of public funds
- Real-time reporting and analytics for program administrators
